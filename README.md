jswars
======
jswars is a project in collaboration with [porter][porterrepo]
to create a modern, HTML5/websocket based interpretation of the turn based
strategy classic Advanced Wars. It is in its early stages as this point, and
currently represents less than what anyone would consider a game, but it's
progressing quickly, and will hopefully soon be a source of great strategic
joy for, at the very least, its authors.

This readme is due for an update, and will receive one soon!
